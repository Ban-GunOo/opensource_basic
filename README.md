all html files should included in templates folder.
and the others will included in django_test folder.


in homework folder, you can find private homeworks which is already submitted.

in testing folder, you can find my private code made by PyQT5 module before team project went web project(not included in current team project)

other codes in root directory are made by myself and fully used in team project.

thank you.
